# Chatbot
Medical Chatbot Project
This project is a Medical Chatbot designed to provide general medical information, assistance, and advice. It leverages machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and a conversational interface to simulate human-like interactions for answering medical queries.

Features
Interactive Chat Interface:

Modern, responsive UI with dark/light mode toggle.
Real-time user and bot messages with typing indicators.
Natural Language Processing (NLP):

The chatbot uses pre-trained models for understanding user queries.
It processes and generates responses contextually.
Medical Knowledge Base:

Access to a vast repository of medical terms, conditions, and treatments.
Handles both general and specific queries (e.g., symptoms, diseases, medication).
Real-Time Suggestions:

Provides first-aid tips and suggests consulting a healthcare professional if needed.
Can answer queries like "What is Acromegaly?" or "Symptoms of diabetes?"
Tech Stack
Backend
Python: Core programming language for backend logic.
Flask: Lightweight framework for handling API requests and managing the chatbot's functionality.
NLP Libraries:
Hugging Face Transformers: For pre-trained models like GPT.
spaCy: Tokenization and text processing.
OpenAI API: GPT-4 for advanced conversational AI.
Frontend
HTML5, CSS3: For building the chat interface.
Bootstrap 4: Responsive styling and UI components.
JavaScript (jQuery): Client-side scripting and AJAX for real-time interactions.
Data Handling
JSON: To handle structured input/output between the frontend and backend.
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone <repository-url>
cd MedicalChatbot
2. Install Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
conda create -n chatbot-env python=3.10 -y
conda activate chatbot-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Add API Keys
Create a .env file in the project directory:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
Replace your_openai_api_key with your OpenAI API key.
4. Run the Application
Start the Flask server:

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
Visit the chatbot at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.

How It Works
User Input: The user enters a medical query in the chat interface.
Query Processing: The query is sent to the backend where NLP and GPT models process it.
Response Generation: A response is generated based on the query context.
Real-Time Interaction: The response is displayed in the chat interface with a typing animation.
Future Enhancements
Voice Input/Output: Add text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities.
Multi-Language Support: Enable the chatbot to respond in multiple languages.
Integration with Medical APIs: Fetch live data like drug information and health statistics.
User Authentication: Allow users to save chat history and access personalized medical advice.
